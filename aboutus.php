		About Us
	</h1>
	<p>
		Weather is currently communicated to the general population through means of weather channels and websites that display forcasts for a broad locale. However, some people may prefer more accurate, personal weather data for their specific location (i.e. those who live in rural areas). Additionally, weather enthusiasts may want to gather their own weather data for analysis. Our weather utility and corresponding web application allow such peronsal monitoring of the weather. By having the weather utility interact with a web application, those using our system are able to also interact with each other.<br><br><br>
